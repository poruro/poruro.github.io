I mean really, really happy?</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Do you want to grow up feeling sorry for not choosing the right path/career in your life? Or if you are an adult, do you want to be on your deathbed regretting things you could have done? No, right! We all want to live a happy, fulfilled, successful and desired life. This book is the solution to help you find the right career, goal, and purpose in life.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">You can become deeply happy and truly fulfilled-provided you do the right thing and in the right way.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">I’m immensely grateful that you are going to read this book. My deep hope is that it serves the full expression of your purpose in life and the goals attached to it, and gives you a 360-degree revolution in transformation within yourself to lead a happy, successful, and meaningful life.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">This book is based on years of research work, my personal  experience,  and  my  experience  of others. In this book, I have tried to cover all topics which will help you find the real purpose of your life; I have left no stones unturned so that you could achieve your maximum potential. This book covers tons of questions that will help you</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">find your true self and your goals. These goals will be yours and only yours, not goals imposed on you by others. The main cause of mental pressure or dissatisfaction is that most of you don’t know what you actually want from life. What do you really want to be? So, you just follow the path others tell you or because your parents or society forces you to do so. You may have a very good career and might have financial freedom too but are you enjoying what you are doing? Do you love your work? Is this what you wanted from life? Marc Anthony said, ‘IF YOU DO WHAT YOU LOVE, YOU’LL NEVER WORK A DAY IN YOUR LIFE.”</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">And it’s so true, we are unhappy only when we have to do something we don’t enjoy doing, and tasks we enjoy doing never seem like work or a burden. Have you noticed that if you have to do something which you love, you don’t mind waking up at midnight also for it, you don’t even realize that you have spent hours doing that? That’s the power of doing things that you love to do.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">I am Kavita Madhar, founder of “The Soul Revival”.  An  author,  successful  business entrepreneur, and a parental life coach. I am on a mission to empower people to live the life of their dreams. I was born with a silver spoon into a business family. Being an Indian, I lived in a</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">culture where most parents would not encourage their children (especially daughters) to follow their dreams or passions. We are told that it’s okay to be passionate about certain things, but we just shouldn’t consider making a career or living out of those passions. I want to be clear that as a child, I’m not even sure if I ever really did have a dream about what I wanted to be. In India, parents and society didn’t give much importance to studies as according to them ultimately a girl has to handle the house only. For them, girls having a career or working under someone was not accepted. But I was always sure I can’t sit at home and be just a homemaker. My parents never denied me anything I wanted to pursue. But at the same time, they were least bothered by my goals. From my first year of college only I have started experimenting  with  different  small  business opportunities. And after my formal education, I opted for jewelry designing and diamond grading courses  and  started  a  jewelry  business  in partnership with my best friend. I was making a good profit but deep inside I was not happy and satisfied. So I opened an institute on mind development programs but due to COVID-19, it shut down. And guess what something inside me was saying -good it shut down! This was the game changer in my life. I started questioning myself why I am not happy with my life. What is that something which I want? All day and night I would try to find the answer to what my purpose</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">in life is. And finally, I’m proud to say that today I know my purpose in life using the techniques I have taught in this book. I don’t want people to go through the same struggle I went through. I want them to follow this book to know their life purpose and goals. In this book, I have also covered  some  common  obstacles  people  go through while reaching their goals. In short, this book is a complete solution to finding your purpose in life, then setting goals to achieve those purposes, and how to cross the barriers to finally reach those goals, thus giving you a life of your dreams.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 99pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table of Contents</p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">INTRODUCTION                    <span class="s5">5</span></h1><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHAPTER 1                      13</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE-Part 1        13</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PURPOSE OF LIFE AND GOALS OF LIFE                         13</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHAPTER 2                      20</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THE PURPOSE OF YOUR LIFE-Part 2        20</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Discover the purpose of your life        20</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Creating Your Underlying Principle:       31</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 147%;text-align: left;">Aligning Your LIFE with Your Underlying Principle:32 CHAPTER 3                      35</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GOALS-PART 1                    35</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHAPTER 4                      40</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">GOALS-Part 2                     40</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reasons Goal Setting Is Important       40</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">What is a goal?                  43</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How to set a goal?                43</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">CHAPTER 5                      50</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ARE YOU STUCK?

Or maybe I didn’t know how to choose a career out of passion.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">I tried different businesses like I was into jewelry, candle making, trousseau packaging, running an institute for kids, etc.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">I made good money doing them. But I was never happy with what I was doing. I never felt that peace or satisfaction doing what I was doing.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Many people asked me, “Why do you need to work? You have such a lovely family, why don’t you spend your life taking care of them?” Yes, I love spending time taking care of my family but that is not all I want. But seriously, I didn’t know what I wanted from life. I was fighting with myself to give meaning to my life. Somewhere, I had lost interest in life and then came the game changer of my life when I started questioning myself. What is my purpose in life? Now I can proudly say I have found my purpose in life following the techniques that I will be teaching you in this book.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 179%;text-align: left;">I see many people are confused between ‘THE GOAL AND PURPOSE OF LIFE.’</p><p style="padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Your life purpose is the ultimate end you have in the sight of where you want to end up. A goal is a benchmark through which you hope to achieve your life purpose. Think of your life purpose as an overall strategy and your goals as a way to keep you on your path so that you arrive where you ultimately want to go.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">For example, say your life purpose is to give all happiness and comforts to your family and contribute  to  the  well-being  of  society.  So, fulfilling your purpose in life could be setting goals like earning extra money by improving some skills or doing a part-time job, etc. so you can contribute to your purpose in life.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">OR</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">One of your broader life purposes might be to empower  others  to  take better  care  of  the environment. A goal that will help you honor this purpose could be as ambitious as organizing a neighborhood campaign to clean up the local park, or as simple as teaching your child to turn the light off when they leave the room.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 19pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Many people have a misconception that being successful in a career or having a large sum of money is happiness but buying a house or luxury car, or opening a new business, can give a sense</p></body></html>
